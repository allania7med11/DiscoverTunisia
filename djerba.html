                <p>Djerba is an island in south Tunisia with beautiful sandy beaches and beautiful, peaceful and silent
                    countryside. One from the best ecological destinations in the World, this island preserves its
                    traditions and its unique architectural theme.</p>

                <h2>Ras Rmel</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Called the Flamingo or Pirates Island, this is a peninsula where flamingoes are present during the
                    colder months starting in October. Ship cruises costing 20 DT per person for walk-ons (and about
                    40-45 DT per person for the hotel groups) are available at the Houmt Souk marina/port. The crews are
                    energetic, passionate, and fun and the buffet lunch on the peninsula is wonderful. The package runs
                    around 9AM to 3:30PM. There is loud dancing music on the boat, but the water is delightful and the
                    trip is worth the price even for non-dancers.</p>

                <h2>Guellala</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A village where pottery has been made since the times of the ancient Romans and where you may watch a
                    wonderful sunset. There is also a museum of patrimony. Entrance fee is 7 DT with 2 for photo rights.
                    One of the nicest museums in Tunisia housed in a beautiful traditional complex and well worth the
                    visit, with detailed explanations in English of both Tunisian and Djerban customs. A caf√© is next
                    door with reasonable prices (1.5 DT for mint tea) and a great view down the hill. This is Djerba's
                    highest spot</p>
