                <hr>
                <p>The South of the country offers some breath-taking experiences and if you are in the mood to leap off your deckchair and engage in some adventurous activities, this could be the region for you.</p>

                <h2>Tamerza Canyon</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The first suggestion is perhaps one of the most mesmeric attractions in the country. After driving for an age around the lifeless desert, you’ll suddenly stumble across the Tamerza Canyon. There is no such thing as a poor view at this attraction and despite what one may initially think in regard to this place, there are several hidden sources of water.</p>

                <h2>Guellala</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A village where pottery has been made since the times of the ancient Romans and where you may watch a
                    wonderful sunset. There is also a museum of patrimony. Entrance fee is 7 DT with 2 for photo rights.
                    One of the nicest museums in Tunisia housed in a beautiful traditional complex and well worth the
                    visit, with detailed explanations in English of both Tunisian and Djerban customs. A café is next
                    door with reasonable prices (1.5 DT for mint tea) and a great view down the hill. This is Djerba's
                    highest spot</p>

                    1992) and the impressive Lalla Hadhria Museum, as well as an interesting interactive traditional
                    village in the back. 12 DT per person includes entrance to all three sections.</p>
